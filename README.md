# algorithmcodes
This is a place to store all my code that was written for my Math 589a/b classes -- Algorithms 1 and 2. These include Python implementations
of QR Factorization, minimal polynomial fitting, power and inverse iteration methods, polynomial interpolation, numerical differentiation, 
and numerical integration using interpolatory formulas and Gaussian Quadrature. The Python files were originally created in Jupyter Notebook.
